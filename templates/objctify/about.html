                "<i>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder</i>", that's what they say atleast, but I don't believe that's the whole picture.
                Beauty isn't entirely subjective, studies have shown there is a fair amount of agreement amongst raters, at least within the same cultures, about who is attractive, and what features make them so.
                For example, actors like Scarlett Johansson or Chris Hemsworth would be considered attractive by the vast majority.
                <br>
                I wanted to find out what intrinsic characteristics affect facial attractiveness.
                During the course of my investigation, I trained a computer, using data gather from reddit, to be able to take in photos and spit out a facial attractiveness rating.
                The idea being to help users choose their most attractive photos to use for online dating and social media profiles (Facebook, Tinder, etc.),
                and create a type of filter that would edit and morph the photo to make the subject appear more attractive.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p>
                To start I needed a large dataset containing imagery of people who have been rated in attractiveness.
                I chose <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/RateMe">/r/RateMe</a>, a subreddit where users submit pictures of themselves and the commenters provide constructive criticism.
                <br>
                It's important to note that Reddit is a highly biased source of this data, and this is in no way a serious scientific endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at a typical submission, I can see that a lot of the commenters rate the subject on the out-of-ten scale, 1 being very unattractive, 10 being very attractive.
                I wrote a script to scrape all the submissions off /r/RateMe, download their pictures, and look through the comments for out-of-ten ratings.
                The idea being the combine the commenters ratings to calculate a final attractiveness score per submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a look at our data, how do the commenters tend to rate the users of /r/RateMe? And by taking the average of these ratings, how attractive are the users?

            <p>
                The obvious thing to see here, is that the out-of-ten rating scale does not appear linear.
                An average looking person should score a 5.
                Instead, we can see that the ratings are centered around 7.5 ish.
                Either reddit users (or those willing to subject themselves to public scrutiny) are all above average, or most rater's shift their range between 5-10, because giving below a 5 feels too mean.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's probably not too surprising, but instead look at the y-axis!
                There's a massive difference in the number of ratings that male and female submissions get.
                Women are far more likely to get a comment rating them out-of-10 than the men.
                After looking further into the data, we can see that women also get a ton more comments on their submissions than the men.

                Keep in mind that submissions with less than 3 ratings were removed from the dataset, hence the sudden drop off in the histograms above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, before we can use this data, we need to clean it up a bit.
                There are a lot of commenters who consistently rate very high, or very low. For example, if someone consistently rates submissions as a 10/10, we struggle to gain meaningful information from this rating.
                I normalize the ratings across the commenters distribution, weighting a commenter on how reliable they are, and then take a weighted average of the commenters ratings per submission. This gives a more accurate final attractiveness score for each submission.
                The plateaus and lack of variance visible in the male rankings below is due to the lack of ratings given to men.

                Okay, what I'm really interested in here, is the characteristics that the top attractive people have, that the bottom, least attractive, people don't have (the shaded grey regions above).
                For that we need to use computer vision to analyse the images submitted by the users.
                Without going in to too much technical detail, I use a <a href="http://dlib.net/">facial landmark detector</a>.
                The landmark detector (Left), looks for faces in images, and identifies a number of key points (or landmarks) around the chin, eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
                From these points we calculate a set of features that we might be interested in, e.g., distances from the eyes, the nose, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this data we can train a machine learning algorithm, a support vector regression, to identify the face shape that reddit deems most attractive.
                We can use this algorithm to predict the attractiveness score of a given face shape.
                Furthermore, since we can give a score to a face shape, then we can keep modifying this shape until we get a higher score.
                Once we've modified the face, maximised the score, we can rerender the original image with the new modified facial features.
                A lot of this work was inspired heavily from a SIGGRAPH'08 paper, <a href="http://leyvand.com/beautification2008/">Data-Driven Enhancement of Facial Attractiveness</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can then observe how these features change from the unattractive, to the attractive redditors.
                Below we show the average face, generated from all the faces in our dataset.
                We then animate that average face towards those rated unattractive(left), and attractive(right).
                In reality, the differences are subtle but the animations here have been exaggerated to show the contrast.

                We can see that short round faces tend to be unattractive, and longer thinner faces are rated more attractive.
                For women, the angle of the eyes change, and the size of the lips.
                While for men the shape of the chin and face length is more important.

            <p>
                We could use this approach to create a "2D beautifier" filter, that would subtly morph people's faces towards the more attractive features, and this is the approach taken by <a href="http://leyvand.com/beautification2008/">Leyvand's SIGGRAPH'08 paper</a>.
                However, this approach has some downsides, it may work well for frontal faces, but once the face turns away from the camera, we start to distort the face in ways that appear unnatural.
                The warping doesnt take into account the perspective change and the 3D structure of the face.
                We'll need to understand how the face is oriented in 3D space in order to solve this problem.

                We need to be able to calculate the 3D face shape of a person even though we are only given a single 2D image of them.
                There are a number of ways to do this, but I used a combination of a <a href="https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos">3D face fitting library</a> and a <a href="http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/CNN3DMM/">CNN trained to output accurate 3D face shapes.</a>
                The CNN uses holistic features in the image to estimate a 3D face model, while the face fitting library uses that 3D model, changing the position, and rotation, until it aligns closely with the image and the detected landmarks.

                We calculate the 3D face shape for all the faces in our RateMe dataset, and from this we create 5 average faces from the from the lowest to the most attractive quintiles.
                Click on the image above to explore these faces in 3D (you'll need a WebGL compatible browser), drag the left click to rotate, right click to move, and scroll to zoom.
                On the right we show an animation morphing between these faces.
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, I then train a machine learning algorithm to identify the face shape that reddit deems most attractive, but this time using 3D features.
                As before, I create a "beautifier" filter that edits a user's photos by morphing the facial features towards the more attractive, and this time it works with a greater range of facial orientations.
